# Virus

It is designed to spread from one host to another and has the ability to replicate. Similarly, just as viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce or spread without programming, for example, a file or document. In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of malicious program or code written to modify the operation of a computer. It is also designed to spread from one computer to another. Viruses insert or attach themselves to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute their code.

## How does it work?
It is a general term that includes many different types of viruses, delivery mechanisms, and impact. To understand how a virus works, it is helpful to divide them into two categories: those that begin infecting and replicating as soon as they enter a computer, and those that remain dormant, waiting for the user to voluntarily execute the code.
A virus has four phases:
- **Dormant phase**: This is when the virus remains hidden in the system.
- **Propagation Phase**: This is the stage where the virus begins to self-replicate, storing copies of itself in files, programs, or other parts of the system.
- **Activation Phase**: This usually requires a specific action to trigger or activate the virus. This can be a user action, such as clicking on an icon or opening an app. Others are programmed to activate after a certain time.
- **Execution Phase**: In this phase, the virus program runs and releases its payload.

## How do they spread?
They usually spread through malicious online downloads, infected email attachments, or when connecting hardware. The most common means are:
- Emails
- Downloads
- Messaging services
- Old software
- Malvertising

## Types of Viruses
- **Direct-action Virus**: The most common and easiest to create, direct-action viruses enter your computer, cause chaos, and then delete themselves. - **Resident virus**: Infects memory and installs itself in the computer's RAM, allowing the virus to persist even if the original virus is deleted.
- **Polymorphic virus**: Changes shape to hide. When they replicate, their clones are slightly different from each other, which helps them avoid detection.
