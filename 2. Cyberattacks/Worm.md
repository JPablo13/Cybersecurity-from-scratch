# Worm

It's a deceptive type of malware designed to spread across multiple devices while remaining active on all of them. The difference between a worm and a virus is the way they spread copies of themselves to uninfected machines. A worm is a self-sufficient malware capable of executing and proliferating without user interaction; the computer doesn't need to be in use for the worm to activate, replicate, and spread.

## How does it work?
As soon as a worm takes hold on a host machine, it can spread across a network without any help or external actions. They exploit hidden vulnerabilities in the computer's operating system. Hackers create this malware to penetrate the target's operating system and do their dirty work without the user's knowledge.

## What types are there?
- **Email:** Its infection vector is through email. These emails include attachments that, when downloaded, are executed or installed, ultimately allowing the worm to access the recipient's device.
- **File sharing:** File-sharing networks operate in a dubious manner, allowing hackers to easily add worms to files in high demand. These file sharing schemes occur primarily on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.
- **Internet:** They do not interact with their victims. Hackers use internet or network worms to exploit vulnerabilities in an operating system.
