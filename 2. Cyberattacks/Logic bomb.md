# Logic bomb

A malicious code that is secretly inserted into a computer network, operating system or software application. It remains inert until a specified condition occurs, when this condition is met, the logic bomb is activated and devastates the system by corrupting data, deleting files or wiping hard drives. They are small pieces of code contained in other programs. Although they can be malicious, in principle they are not, although it is a fine line.

## Characteristics
- Remains inert for a set amount of time: Like common timer bombs, logic bombs are not intended to be triggered directly.
- Its payload is unknown until the moment it is activated: The payload is the malware component that performs the malicious activity.
- The activity is a certain condition: The logic bomb trigger is the condition that must be met.

## Examples.

### Siberian Pipeline Sabotage
In 1982, the first attack of this type is considered to have occurred. The CIA was allegedly informed that a KGB agent had stolen from a Canadian company the plans for an advanced control system, along with its software, for use on a pipeline in Siberia. The CIA had apparently programmed a logic bomb into the system to sabotage its enemy.

### UBS attack by Roger Duronio
In 2006 at the investment banking firm UBS. The attack was led by Roger Duronio, a system administrator at UBS Group AG. It seems that Duronio was not satisfied with his incentive pay, so he decided to “get revenge” by means of a time bomb malware attack. His goal was to wipe out the company's servers so that traders could not trade. When the bomb went off it disabled 2000 servers in 400 offices.**
