# Zero-day attack

Describes newly discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers use to attack a system. It refers to the fact that the vendor or developer has just learned of a flaw, which means that they have had “zero days” to fix it. It is very important to understand the difference between vulnerability, exploit, attack.
- Vulnerability: It is the gateway used by a cybercriminal to affect a specific system, since developers are not aware of its existence and there are no security patches.
- Exploit: It is the attack method used by cybercriminals to attack a system with an unpatched vulnerability.
- Attack: The use of the zero-day exploit to cause damage or steal data from an infected system.
