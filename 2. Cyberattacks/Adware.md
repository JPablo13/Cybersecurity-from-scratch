# Adware

Displays ads on the screen automatically, usually occurs within a web browser. Redirects search results to advertising websites and may collect user data to sell to advertisers without the user's knowledge. This is not always malware, as it is sometimes legitimate programs.

## How does it work?

It has a silent installation on end devices with the purpose of clicking on the ads that are displayed, whether by accident or not. The creators and marketers make money by:
* Pay Per Click (PPC)
* Pay Per View (PPV)
* Pay Per Install (PPI)

## Examples

### Fireball
It came to light in 2017 when an Israeli software company discovered that 250 million computers and one-fifth of the world's corporate networks were infected with this adware. When it affects a device it takes over the browser. It changes the home page to a search engine, Trotus, inserts annoying ads in the web pages visited; it also does not allow you to modify browser settings.

### Appearch
It is a common adware program that acts as a browser hijacker. It is usually bundled with other freeware and inserts so many ads that moving around the browser becomes a very complicated task. When you try to visit a website, Appearch.info opens instead. If you manage to open a web page, Appearch converts random blocks of text into links so that when you select a text a pop-up window opens inviting you to download software updates.
