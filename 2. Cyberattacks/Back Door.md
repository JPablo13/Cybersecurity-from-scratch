# Backdoor

Any method that allows someone to remotely access devices without the user's permission or knowledge. Hackers can install a backdoor on the device using malware, exploiting software vulnerabilities, or even installing it directly on the device's hardware/firmware.

## How does it work?
For hackers to install a backdoor on a device, they must first gain access to it, either through physical access, a malware attack, or by exploiting system vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities include open ports, weak passwords, outdated software, or weak firewalls.

## Examples

### DoublePulsar Cryptojacker
In 2017, security researchers discovered that the DoublePulsar backdoor malware (originally developed by the NSA) was being used to monitor Windows PCs by installing a cryptojacker on computers with sufficient memory and CPU power. The cryptojacker then stole the processing power of infected computers to mine Bitcoin.

### PoisonTap
This is a backdoor malware that allows hackers to access almost any logged-in website (including sites protected with two-factor authentication). PoisonTap is a pretty terrifying piece of malware, but fortunately, it can only be installed by directly connecting a Raspberry Pi computer to the victim's USB port.
