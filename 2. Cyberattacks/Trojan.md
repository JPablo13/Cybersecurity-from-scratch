# Trojan

This is a type of malware that often disguises itself as legitimate software. It can be used to try to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into downloading and running Trojans on their devices. Once activated, they can give cybercriminals access to spy, steal sensitive information, and gain backdoor access to the system.

##How does it work?
The user must activate it for it to do its job. Trojans can infect devices in several ways, including:
- **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Malicious emails with infected attachments or links to malicious websites are one of the main ways Trojans are distributed.
- **Drive-by Downloads and Malicious Websites**: Visiting compromised or malicious websites can lead to automatic downloads of Trojans, often disguised as useful software or updates.

- **Software from Untrusted Sources**: Downloading software from unofficial websites, P2P networks, or unverified sources increases the risk of downloading Trojans disguised as legitimate programs.
- **Fake Wi-Fi Networks (Evil Twin)**: Attackers create Wi-Fi access points with names similar to legitimate networks to trick users into redirecting them to malicious websites that distribute Trojans through browser exploits or deceptive downloads.

## Types of Trojans
- **Backdoors**: These give malicious users remote control of the infected device, allowing attackers to remotely access the device without the user's authorization.
- **Exploits**: Exploits are programs that contain data or code that exploit a vulnerability in application software running on the device. - **Clampi Trojan:** Also known as Ligats e llom, it waits for users to log in to perform a financial transaction, such as accessing online banking or entering credit card details for an online purchase. It is sophisticated enough to hide behind firewalls and remain undetected for an extended period.
- **Wacatac Trojan:** This is a highly damaging Trojan threat that can carry out various malicious actions on the target system. It is classified as a remote access Trojan (RAT) and can perform a wide range of malicious actions, including information theft, remote system control, downloading and installing additional malware, and more.
