# Ransomware

Ransomware is a form of extortion software that can block access to a system or its files and then demand a ransom for their release.

## How does it work?
Ransomware infection occurs in the following way.
First, the malware gains access to the device. Depending on the type of ransomware, it will encrypt the entire operating system or specific files. The program then demands a ransom from the victim. Because malware is designed to remain **undetected for as long as possible**, an infection is difficult to detect.

## How does it occur?
The most common ways are: visiting malicious or compromised websites, downloading malicious attachments, infected software or downloads, or software vulnerabilities.

## Types
The type also makes a big difference when it comes to identifying and dealing with the effects of ransomware. These include:
**Lockdown ransomware**: Blocks basic computer functions, preventing access to the operating system or essential functions, but does not encrypt the user's files.
**Encryption ransomware**: Much more common and damaging, it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible without the decryption key. It is the most widespread type of ransomware and the one that causes the most losses.

## Examples

### WannaCry
This is an encryption ransomware. Cybercriminals use it to extort payments from users. It attacks by encrypting valuable files so they cannot be accessed or by blocking access to the computer so they cannot be used. It is believed to have infected around 230,000 computers worldwide, causing an estimated $4 billion in losses.

### CryptoLocker
Cybercriminals used CryptoLocker to gain access to a system and encrypt files. They used social engineering techniques to trick employees into downloading it to their computers, which then infected the network. Once downloaded, it displayed a ransom message offering to decrypt the data if the attacker complied. The operators are believed to have obtained around $3 million.
