# DDoS attack

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack seeks to exceed the capacity of a network resource such as a website or server by sending a massive volume of malicious requests. The main goal is to disrupt the service and make it inaccessible to legitimate users. In some cases, attackers may demand a ransom to stop the attack. Usually such attacks are used to discredit or damage a competitor's business. To send an extremely large number of requests to the victim resource, the hacker uses a “botnet” of affected computers.

## How does it work?
All network resources have a finite limit on the number of requests they can handle at any one time. In addition to the server capacity limit, the channel connecting the server to the Internet has a limited bandwidth capacity. When there is an amount of requests that exceeds the capacity limits the services are affected, as follows:
- The attack consumes all available bandwidth.
- The server is overwhelmed by the number of requests and cannot process them all.

## How to detect a DDoS attack?
There is no way to detect a DDoS attack, but there are signs that can help identify it.
- Unusual and sudden increase in web traffic.
- Irregular performance or slow network
- The web site goes completely offline

## How to avoid it?
- Develop a defense strategy.
- Identify security gaps and assess possible threats in the configuration.

## How to protect against a DDoS attack?
- Perform a risk analysis on a regular basis.
- Organize a DDoS attack response team.
- Incorporate intrusion detection and prevention tools.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the defense strategy.
