# Phishing

Phishing is the crime of tricking people into sharing confidential information such as passwords and credit card numbers. There are several techniques used to trick people into falling for this type of attack, but the most common is phishing. Victims receive an email or text message that pretends to be from a trusted person or organization. When the victim opens the email or text message, they will find a potentially frightening message. Typically, the message demands that the victim go to a website and act immediately, or they will face the consequences.
