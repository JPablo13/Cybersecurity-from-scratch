# Spyware

This often includes collecting sensitive data (such as passwords, PINs, and credit card numbers), monitoring keystrokes, tracking browsing habits, and harvesting email addresses.
These activities also affect network performance by slowing down the system and affecting entire business processes. They are generally classified into three main categories:
- **Trojan horse spyware** that infects computers in the form of Trojan horse malware.
