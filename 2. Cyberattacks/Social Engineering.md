# Social Engineering

This is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to obtain private information, access, or valuables. These "human hacking" scams tend to trick unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections, or granting access to restricted systems. Attacks can occur online, in person, and through other interactions.

## Traits of this Attack
- **Emotion Escalation:** Emotional manipulation gives attackers the upper hand in any interaction. Emotions are used equally to convince you.
- **Urgency:** Urgent opportunities or requests are another reliable tool in an attacker's arsenal. They may be motivated to commit to a compromise due to seemingly serious issues that need immediate attention.
- **Trust:** Credibility is invaluable and essential for an attack of this type. At this point, the attacker can create a profile to easily entice the victim.
