# Malware

Any software code or computer program intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Nearly all modern cyberattacks involve some form of malware. These malicious programs can take many forms, from costly and damaging ransomware to merely annoying adware.

## What is it used for?
- Holding devices, data, or entire business networks hostage for financial gain.
- Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or digital assets.
- Stealing login credentials, credit card numbers, intellectual property, or other valuable information.
- Disrupting critical systems that businesses and government agencies rely on.

## Types
- **Virus:** A virus is malicious code that hides legitimate software to damage and distribute copies of itself.
- **Ransomware:** Ransomware locks a victim's devices or data and demands a ransom, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, to unlock them.

- **Cryptojackers:** Takes control of a device and uses it to mine cryptocurrency, without the owner's knowledge.
- **Fileless malware:** Uses vulnerabilities in legitimate software programs such as web browsers and word processors to inject malicious code directly into a computer's memory.
- **Worm:** Self-replicating malicious programs that can spread between applications and devices without human interaction.
- **Trojan:** Disguises itself as useful programs or hides within legitimate software to trick users into installing them.
- **Rootkits:** Malware bundles that allow hackers to gain privileged, administrator-level access to a computer's operating system or other assets.
- **Scareware:** Scares users into downloading malware or passing sensitive information to a scammer. It typically appears as a sudden pop-up window with an urgent message, often displaying a warning.
- **Spyware:** lurks on an infected computer, secretly collecting sensitive information and transmitting it to an attacker.
- **Adware:** Spams a device with unwanted pop-up ads. Adware is often bundled with free software, unbeknownst to the user. When the user installs the program, they unwittingly install the adware as well.
