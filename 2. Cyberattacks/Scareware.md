# Scareware

Fear-based social engineering tactics are commonly used to deceive users. It is often presented as legitimate software (antivirus programs, system cleaners, etc.) and uses fake alerts to scare victims into purchasing or installing useless or malicious software.

## How does it work?
Pop-ups appear to "warn" that pornographic or dangerous files have been found on the device and will continue to appear until the "remove threats" buttons are clicked. They are designed to appear as genuine warning messages through the use of social engineering tactics. These tactics are designed to incite feelings of panic and fear. This is done to trick users into making hasty and irrational decisions.
The least harmful outcome would be a loss of money and installing useless software that doesn't fix the device. The most harmful option would be for the scammer to use card numbers and personal data to steal money and commit identity theft. It could even take the contents of the hard drive hostage, forcing a ransom to be paid.
What cybercriminals want the user to do is:
- Buy fake/useless software
- Download various types of malware
- Visit websites that automatically download and install malware on devices.

## Examples
Many scareware programs copy user interface elements from real malware protection programs and use legitimate-sounding names. Some examples include:
- XP Antivirus/AntivirusXP
- Antivirus360
- PC Protector
