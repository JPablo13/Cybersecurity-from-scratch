# Cloud Fundamentals

Cloud-based technologies allow organizations to access computing, storage, software, and servers over the internet. They move the organization's technology component to a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Services from Different Cloud Providers

## Cloud Services

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS allows users to access applications and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure, while users store data on the cloud provider's servers:

*Example*: A user uses Google Workspace to access Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Docs without installing any software.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Allows an organization to remotely access the development tools and services used to deliver those applications for a subscription.

*Example*: A developer creates an application on Heroku. You don't need to worry about setting up servers or databases, as Heroku provides the tools and services necessary for development.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. The provider hosts the hardware, software, and storage components; the user pays for the use of these resources, usually on a flexible, on-demand basis.

*Example*: A company contracts AWS EC2 virtual instances to host its servers. The company is responsible for installing the operating system and applications, while AWS provides the virtualized hardware.

## Cloud Types

Cloud computing has different classifications, which are based on the implementation method of the service models.

### Private Cloud
Also known as an internal, corporate, or enterprise cloud, a private cloud is hosted on a private platform. It offers the organization more control over its data, but can be more expensive than other cloud services due to infrastructure, maintenance, and administration costs.

Example: A bank uses its own infrastructure to host critical systems such as customer databases, ensuring full control over the data.

### Public Cloud
It is hosted by a service provider in an off-site facility. Users pay a monthly or annual subscription to access their services. This option costs the organization less infrastructure, maintenance, and administration, but the organization has less control over its data.

Example: A startup uses Google Cloud services to store data and run its applications, reducing infrastructure and maintenance costs.

### Hybrid Cloud
This is a cloud that combines both a private and public cloud, offering control over the organization's data and combining the data control of a private cloud with the scalability of a public cloud.
Example: An online store stores confidential customer information in its own cloud but uses Microsoft Azure to scale during promotions or peak demand periods.

### Community Cloud
This is a collaborative effort in which more than one organization shares and uses the same platform. This type of cloud is geared toward the needs of industries such as healthcare or energy services.
Example: Several universities share a community cloud to store scientific research, optimizing resources and ensuring collaborative access.

## Cloud Native Application Protection

### Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)
Defined as:
"A unified and tightly integrated set of security and compliance capabilities designed to protect cloud-native applications during development and production. They consolidate a wealth of previously siloed capabilities, including container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure-as-code scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlement management, runtime cloud workload protection, and runtime vulnerability/configuration scanning."

### Key Protections

#### Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Visibility, governance, and regulatory compliance are key to true CSPM coverage.
Security standards are important to prevent successful attacks. This requires ensuring that cloud resources and SaaS applications are properly configured and comply with the organization's security standards from day one. It is also important to ensure that these applications and the data they collect and store are properly protected and compliant with regulations to avoid costly fines, damage to brand reputation, or loss of customer trust.

#### Cloud Workload Protection (CWP)
Provides consistent visibility and controls, including vulnerability scanning in the development process, runtime workload protection, application control, memory protection, behavioral monitoring, host-based intrusion prevention, and optional anti-malware protection.

#### Cloud Code Security
Addresses the challenges security teams face when trying to keep up with DevOps teams and infrastructure automation by integrating security throughout the development lifecycle.

#### Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)
The process of managing identities and privileges in cloud environments. Its objective is to understand existing access rights in cloud and multi-cloud environments and identify and mitigate risks arising from rights that grant a higher level of access than is appropriate. CIEM solutions help companies reduce their attack surface in the cloud and mitigate access risks posed by excessive permissions.

## Main Threats

Cloud computing is susceptible to many threats that affect the physical networks of any company. However, there are unique threats, including:

**Data Breach**: This occurs when an unauthorized entity accesses protected, sensitive data.

**Cloud Misconfiguration**: This occurs when a cloud computing resource is configured incorrectly, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Common examples include open storage permissions, exposed unencrypted databases, and a lack of adequate access control policies.

**Poor Cloud Security Architecture**: Since different cloud models have different responsibilities behind system security, this can lead to vulnerabilities if the cloud security architecture is not fully understood or is implemented incorrectly.

**Shared Account Credentials**: This occurs when user accounts or access privileges are not well protected and are hijacked by attackers. This poses a significant security threat if the account has high privileges.

**Insider threat**: This occurs when an employee, contractor, or business partner maliciously or unintentionally compromises the cloud service.
## Cloud Infrastructure Security

### Company Security Policies
Well-established and well-defined company security policies and user training are effective ways to manage unknown applications.

### Microsegmentation
Leverages virtual network topologies to run multiple, smaller, and isolated networks without incurring additional hardware costs. This technique allows for more granular control over traffic security and workflows within the cloud.

### Layered Security
Each cloud resource can be protected at multiple levels, such as:
- **Hardware Layer**: Use of secure devices in data centers.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Proper configuration of virtual networks, firewalls, and VPNs.
- **Platform Layer**: Implementation of access controls to database services and runtime environments.
- **Application Layer**: Use of mechanisms such as version control and software security testing.

## Cloud Application Security

### Code Signing
Helps prove that a piece of software is authentic. Executables designed to be installed and run on a device are digitally signed to validate the author's identity and ensure that the software code has not changed since it was signed.

### Secure Cookies
The use of secure cookies protects stored information from unauthorized access. Web developers should use cookies with HTTPS to secure cookies and prevent them from being transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.

### Version Control
Version control is used to prevent accidental changes made by authorized users. This means that two users cannot update the same object, whether it be files, database records, or a transaction, at exactly the same time.

## Cloud Data Security
### Cryptography
Encryption is the process of encoding data so that unauthorized persons cannot easily read it. When data is unencrypted, it is called plaintext; the encrypted version is ciphertext.
There are two types of encryption:
- **Symmetric encryption algorithms**: These use the same pre-shared key to encrypt and decrypt data. They have a fixed block size of 128 bits with a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
- **Asymmetric encryption algorithm**: These use a key for encryption that is different from the key used for decryption. These algorithms include Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Diffie-Hellman, EIGamal, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

### Hashing
A hash is a tool that ensures data integrity by taking binary data and producing a fixed-length representation called a hash value. These functions are one-way functions used to verify and ensure data integrity. Such a tool can also verify authentication.
Cryptographic hash functions have the following properties:
- The input can be of any length.
- The output has a fixed length.
- The hash function is one-way and irreversible.
- Two different input values ​​will almost never result in the same hash.
Hashing is made up of the SHA family:
- SHA-224 (224 bits)
- SHA-256 (256 bits)
- SHA-384 (384 bits)
- SHA-512 (512 bits)

### Cloud Encryption Implementation
- **In transit**: Use of TLS 1.2 or 1.3 to secure communication between client and server.
- **At rest**: Automatic encryption of databases and storage using keys managed by the cloud provider.
- **In use**: Emerging techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Performs calculations directly on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it, ensuring information privacy even while it is being processed. Although it offers significant potential for protecting sensitive data, its implementation still faces performance-related challenges) to protect data during processing.
