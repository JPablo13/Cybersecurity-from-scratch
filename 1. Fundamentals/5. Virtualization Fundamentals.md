# Virtualization Fundamentals

## What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual representation of physical and logical resources using software. This includes servers, storage, networks, operating systems, and applications. This practice allows for better use of available resources, greater flexibility, and scalability in IT environments.

## What is a Hypervisor?

It is the heart of virtualization; it is the intermediary between virtual machines and a physical server, allowing for the correct allocation of resources. There are two types of hypervisors:

### Type 1 or Bare-Metal Hypervisor
It is installed directly on the physical hardware, without the need for an operating system; it is more efficient. It is often used in enterprise environments. Some examples are: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-v, Xen, or KVM.

### Type 2 or Hosted Hypervisor
It runs on top of an existing operating system as an additional program, making it easier to install but less efficient. Some examples are VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, or QEMU.

## Virtualized Environments

Virtualization is a practice that helps organizations reduce the number of physical machines needed in their IT environment. A virtual system can be comprised of several different elements:

### Virtual Machines (VMs)
These are complete virtualized operating systems that run on a hypervisor. It is important to keep them updated and secure, as they share hardware and run with elevated privileges. If a VM is compromised, the host could also be at risk.

### Containers
These are lightweight environments that include an application and its dependencies, sharing the host operating system kernel. Docker is one of the most widely used platforms for this type of virtualization. Although more efficient, if a container with elevated privileges is compromised, the underlying operating system could also be affected.

### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
Users' desktop environments can be stored remotely on a server using thin clients or virtual desktops. This makes it much easier to quickly create, delete, copy, archive, or download configurations over the network. This requires high availability and storage capacity.

## Types of Virtualization

### Server Virtualization
This virtualization seeks to create multiple virtual servers starting from a single physical server. This allows multiple operating systems to run independently and simultaneously if needed. It consists of the following elements: server, hypervisor, and finally, virtualized machines.

### Desktop Virtualization
This allows users to work on a machine with all their processes and applications, but without the need to physically access that machine.

### Hardware Resource Virtualization
This is the logical simulation of hardware resources. This includes the virtualization of main memory (RAM), storage drives, and network interfaces.

### Network Virtualization
This separates the physical network into multiple virtual networks or joins multiple physical networks into a single virtual network. You can also implement technologies such as SDN (Software Defined Networking) to manage networks programmatically.

### Application Virtualization
Allows applications to run from a remote server without installing them directly on the user's physical machine.

## Types of Networks in Hypervisors

### NAT
Shares the host system's network connection, allowing access to the internet and local network devices. Virtual machines have a private IP address, making them inaccessible from the outside. Ideal for testing or laboratory environments.

### Bridge Adapter
Connects the virtual machine directly to the physical network, assigning it its own public IP address, making it visible to the outside world. Useful for simulating production environments.

### Internal
Allows communication only between virtual machines on the same internal network, created by the hypervisor. **No** connection to the host system or the external physical network. Suitable for isolated laboratories and test environments.

## Virtual Machine Protection

Just like a physical computer, virtual machines require patches, updates, and anti-malware measures to protect them from external threats. Depending on the specific tools available on a platform, the cloud offers additional security options to protect virtual machines, including:

### Subnet Location
Carefully designate the subnet for each instance so that it only has the necessary access to the outside world.
### Disable ports and services
Enable only the necessary services and ports to reduce unnecessary external exposure.
### Account management and policies
Disable default user accounts and create user accounts with recommended account management policies, such as password complexity and least-privileged access.
### Install antivirus/antimalware software
Installing software to protect the virtual machine is crucial; in some cases, it may be available as a service from the cloud platform.
### Implement host-based firewalls/IPS/IDP software
Configure host-based firewalls and use IPS/IDS services to monitor and protect virtual machines against external threats. On some cloud platforms, this can be available as a service.

## Disadvantages of virtualization

Some disadvantages that virtualized environments can have are:
- Virtual machine sprawl, which occurs when too many underutilized servers consume more resources and space than necessary for the work they perform.
- Virtual machine crash, which occurs when the virtual machine crashes and interacts with the host operating system.
