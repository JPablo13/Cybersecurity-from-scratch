# Network Fundamentals

A network is a structure composed of several nodes, whether computers, mobile devices, servers, or any other device capable of sending and receiving information. These nodes are interconnected through communication channels. These can be physical (copper or fiber optic cables) or wireless (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi). The purpose of any network is always to share resources such as files, directories, and applications, as well as to facilitate electronic communication between devices and their users. Within a network, data circulates in the form of packets that travel from one point to another following rules defined by protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, etc.

## Types of Networks

Networks are primarily divided based on their scope, size, and the users they can impact. They are divided into:

### LAN or Local Area Network
These are networks of limited size, usually confined, for example, to a building or group of nearby buildings. They are ideal for environments where greater speed and security are desired, as their smaller size allows for better management.

### WAN or Wide Area Network
This type of network works to interconnect cities or even countries. An example of this network is the Internet, as it connects multiple LANs dispersed throughout the world.

### MAN or Metropolitan Area Network
This is a network that covers a larger area than a LAN, but is not as large as a WAN to interconnect cities or countries.

### PAN or Personal Area Network
This is the smallest type of network available, as it is limited to a single individual's personal devices that can communicate with each other.

### VPN or Virtual Private Network
This establishes an encrypted tunnel to protect network traffic as it travels over a public network, such as the Internet. This ensures data confidentiality and integrity, using protocols such as IPsec, OpenVPN, or WireGuard.

## Network Topologies

A topology describes how devices are organized and connected in a network, either physically (the actual layout of cables and devices) or logically (describing how data flows through the network). There are different topologies, such as:
- **Bus**: All devices are connected to a central cable that acts as a highway for all network data. This is the simplest and lowest-cost topology to implement; however, it poses the greatest risk, since if the central cable fails, the network is lost.
- **Star**: All devices are connected to a hub or switch, which is the center of the network.
- **Ring**: Devices are connected in a ring, and data passes from one device to another in a single direction. This ensures that the data has to travel the entire ring to reach its endpoint.
- **Mesh**: Connects multiple devices together, allowing multiple paths for data transmission. There are two types:
- **Full Mesh:** All devices are directly connected to each other, providing maximum redundancy, but at a high cost.
- **Partial Mesh:** Only some devices are interconnected, reducing cost and complexity at the expense of less redundancy.
- **Tree**: This is a variant of the star topology, where devices are organized into interconnected groups that branch out from a central point. It combines the advantages of star and bus topologies, allowing for scalability and flexibility for the future.

## Traffic Distribution Patterns
Traffic distribution patterns describe how data will be transmitted between devices on a network. They can be divided into several types depending on how the data is transmitted, such as:
**Unicast**: One-to-one communication between a sender and a receiver.
**Broadcast**: Sending data to all devices on a network or subnetwork simultaneously.
**Multicast**: Sending data from a device to a specific group within the same network.
**Loopback**: Allows a single device to send data to itself.
**AnyCast**: Sends data to a group of devices, but only the closest node in terms of routing receives and processes the request.
**GeoCast**: Similar to multicast, but with the difference that transmission is restricted to a specific geographic area.
**Peer to Peer**: Direct communication between two devices where the network path the information follows is established.
**Point to MultiPoint**: Based on a single sender transmitting to multiple specific receivers, but through a common channel.
## What is an IP address?
An IP address is a unique number assigned to each device connected to a network that uses this protocol to communicate. This number, in addition to identifying the device on the network, also allows its location within the same network to be determined. This address can be assigned statically (it never changes automatically) or dynamically (it can change automatically depending on the context). Within a network, no two devices can have the same IP address.
Within the IP protocol, there are two versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 was created because IPv4 no longer has enough space to meet current demands; IPv4 has a very small maximum limit for today's needs.

## What is a mask?
All IP addresses are divided into two sections: one that identifies the network and the other that identifies the host. The network section is the part of the IP address intended to identify the network, and the host section is used to specifically identify the host. The mask is associated with an IP address and, as such, indicates how much of the IP address is used as a network identifier, and therefore, how much space is left to assign a host.

## Types of IPv4 Addresses

### By Use and Distribution Pattern
**Unicast Addresses**: Used for direct communications between a sender and a receiver in a single manner. This is the most common and is used for standard network traffic, including, for example, web browsing.
**Broadcast Addresses**: Used to send data to all devices within a specific network or subnet at the same time.
**Multicast Addresses**: Allows delivery of information to a specific group within a network. The available IP range is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.
**Loopback Addresses**: Used for the system to send messages to itself. Their available IP address range is 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.

### By Range and Scope
**Private Addresses**: These are IP address ranges reserved for internal use; in other words, they are addresses that are not routable on the Internet. Their ranges are:
- **Class A:** 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
- **Class B:** 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
- **Class C:** 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)
**Experimental and future use**: Not intended for general Internet use, their range is 240.0.0.0/4 to 255.255.255.254.
**CGNAT Addresses**: Carrier-Grade NAT is a technology that many ISPs are adopting so that customers can browse the Internet with a single public IP address. These addresses use the following range: 100.64.0.0/10 (100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255).
**Public Addresses**: These are all available IP addresses, and their ranges are:
(1.0.0.0 to 9.255.255.255)
(11.0.0.0 to 172.15.255.255)
(172.32.0.0 to 192.167.255.255)
(192.169.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)

## What is a MAC Address?

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network interface. Although it is fixed at the hardware level, it can be temporarily changed at the software level, a common practice in security audits, although it can be detected.

## What is a port?

It is a type of input and output data channel that allows applications or services to communicate outside the device through them. The available port range is 65536. Ports can be divided into three categories: Well-known ports (from 0-1023), Registered ports (from 1024-49151), and Dynamic or private ports (from 49152-65535).

## Port Table

## What is a service?
A service is a function offered by a device to other devices within the same network or over the internet. Some examples are: sharing files, printers, email, databases, remote administration access, website access, and more.
## What is a protocol?
A network protocol defines the format and order of messages at the exchange level between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions to be taken during the transmission and reception of those messages. In other words, the protocol establishes the guidelines by which communication is governed.
## OSI Model
The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization, which allows various communication systems to connect using standard protocols. The OSI model can be seen as a universal language for connecting computer networks. It is based on the concept of dividing a communication system into seven layers, each of which has a specific function and communicates with the layers above and below it.

## Why is the OSI model important?
Although the modern internet does not strictly follow the OSI model, this model is still very useful for troubleshooting network problems. Whether it's an individual who can't get their computer to connect to the internet or a website that's down for thousands of users, this model can help break down the problem and isolate the source. If the existing problem can be reduced to a specific layer of the model, a lot of unnecessary work can be avoided.

## What are the layers of the OSI model?
The OSI model has 7 layers, which are as follows:

### 7. Application Layer
This is the only layer that directly interacts with user data. Software applications such as web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communication. It should be clear that client software applications are not part of this layer; rather, the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user.

### 6. Presentation Layer
This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data for use by the application layer; in other words, this layer prepares the data for consumption by applications.
It is responsible for data translation, encryption, and understanding. If devices communicate over an encrypted connection, this same layer is responsible for adding encryption at the sender's end and decoding at the receiver's end, in order to present decrypted and readable data to the application layer. Another function of this layer is to compress the data it receives from the application layer before sending it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication.

### 5. Session Layer
It is responsible for opening and closing communications between two devices. The time between opening and closing the communication is known as the session. This layer ensures that the session remains open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged. When the exchange ends, it will promptly close the session to avoid wasting resources. It also synchronizes data transfer using checkpoints, so that in the event of a disconnection or crash, the session can be restarted from where it left off.

### 4. Transport Layer
It is responsible for end-to-end communications between two devices. This involves taking data from the session layer and then fragmenting it into smaller pieces called segments before proceeding to execute the transmission to layer 3. The transport layer of the receiving device is then responsible for reassembling these segments and constructing data from them that the session layer can consume.
It is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control determines an optimal transmission rate to ensure that a sender with a fast connection does not overwhelm a receiver with a slower connection. It performs error control at the receiving end by ensuring that the received data is complete and requesting a retransmission if it is not.

### 3. Network Layer
This layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the communicating devices are on the same network, then the network layer is not necessary. This layer divides the transport layer segments into smaller units, called packets, on the sender's device and reassembles these packets on the receiving device. It also looks for the best physical path for data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.

### 2. Data Link Layer
This facilitates data transfer between two devices within the same network. It takes packets from the network layer and divides them into smaller parts called frames. Similar to the network layer, this layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in network communications.

### 1. Physical Layer
This layer includes the physical equipment involved in data transfer, such as cables and network switches. This layer is where data is converted into a sequence of bits.
## TCP/IP Model
Currently the de facto standard for computer network communication worldwide, it is a set of network protocols that determines the requirements for establishing secure and efficient online data transfer.

### Main Features
- **Device Compatibility**: Since it became the standard, most current devices and operating systems are designed to be compatible with this model, facilitating communication between different vendors.
- **Interoperability**: This allows communication between different operating systems using the same TCP/IP protocol suite.
- **Flexibility**: It allows for supporting a wide range of applications and services, providing a solid foundation for web browsing, video streaming, or file transfers.
- **Reliability and Error Control**: It offers multiple mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery, providing enumeration, traceability, and tracking for each segment sent to ensure that all data arrives correctly.

## What are the layers of the TCP/IP model?
This model consists of four layers:

### Application Layer
This deals with the interaction between applications and the network. The protocols that interact with this layer are intended to establish the rules and formats necessary for applications to exchange information effectively, providing interoperability.

### Transport Layer
This manages end-to-end connections and ensures reliable data delivery.

### Internet Layer
This is responsible for routing data packets through the network. It also divides and assembles data into smaller packets for transmission.

### Data Link Layer
This deals with the physical transmission of data over a network medium, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics. It specifies the technical details and protocols used for communication on the local network.

## Protocol Distribution

![Network Models.png](https://github.com/JPablo13/Curso-Introductorio-a-la-Ciberseguridad/blob/main/Recursos%20Visuales/Modelos%20de%20red.png)

## Protocols

### Application Layer
- **HTTP** and **HTTPS**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, are the protocols or set of rules for client-server communication.
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is a communication protocol used to send and receive email messages over the Internet.
- **SSH**: Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their servers over the Internet with an authentication mechanism.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol, is used to transfer all types of files between computers connected to a network.

- **DNS**: Domain Name System, responsible for translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.
- **DHCP**: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, responsible for assigning IP addresses to new devices on a network or devices that request a new IP address.
- **RIP**: Routing Information Protocol, used to manage router information on a self-contained network.
- **SNMP**: Simple Network Management Protocol, is a protocol designed for managing information transfer on networks, especially for use on LANs.

### Transport Layer
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol, is a communications standard for delivering data and messages across the network (reliable, connection-oriented).
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol, used on the Internet for time-sensitive transmission. (fast, connectionless)

### Network Layer
- **IP**: Internet Protocol, the set of rules that govern the format of data sent over the internet or local area network.
- **ARP**: Address Resolution Protocol, which dynamically converts internet addresses into unique hardware addresses for local area networks.
- **IGMP**: Internet Group Management Protocol, which allows multiple devices to share the same IP address so they can all receive the same data.
- **ICMP**: Internet Control Message Protocol, which provides a standardized mechanism for network devices to communicate crucial information, such as connectivity and network status.

### Network Access Layer
- **ETHERNET**: Allows devices to exchange data packets with each other over a network to communicate.
- **Frame Relay**: A packet-switching technology used in WANs to transmit data efficiently and reliably.
## What is TTL?
Time To Live is used to limit the duration or number of hops a packet can make within the network before being discarded. This is useful because it prevents the packet from hopping indefinitely and prevents the creation of routing loops.

## Connection Establishment Mechanisms
These are the processes and protocols designed to initiate a communication session between two points on a network. In other words, it is the initial process where devices negotiate the necessary parameters to begin and ensure data transmission between them. There are many types, including:
- TCP Handshake: Known as the Three-Way Handshake, it is operated by the TCP protocol and ensures a reliable connection. For this mechanism to work, three steps are required: Step 1: Sending the SYN segment; Step 2: Responding with a SYN-ACK; Step 3: Receiving the SYN-ACK segment and sending the ACK segment.
- UDP: Unlike TCP, this mechanism does not establish a prior connection; here, a handshake does not exist; datagrams are sent directly without guaranteeing delivery, order, or integrity.

## Firewalls
A system or group of systems that enforces an access control policy between networks.

### Common Properties of Firewalls
- They resist network attacks.
- They are the only point of transit between internal corporate networks and external networks.
- They enforce the access control policy.

### Advantages of Firewalls
- They prevent the exposure of sensitive hosts, resources, and applications to untrusted users.
- They sanitize protocol flow, preventing the exploitation of protocol flaws.
- They block malicious data from servers and clients.
- They simplify security administration.

### Firewall Limitations
- A misconfigured firewall can have serious consequences for the network, for example, becoming a single point of failure.
- Data from many applications cannot be transmitted securely through firewalls.
- Users may seek ways to circumvent the firewall to receive blocked content, exposing the network to potential attacks.
- Network speed may be reduced.
- Unauthorized traffic can be tunneled or hidden as legitimate traffic through the firewall.

## Types of Firewalls
### Host-Based Firewall
This is a security solution installed directly on an individual device, specifically protecting the host on which it is installed. It filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules, protecting the device from unauthorized access. Common examples include Windows Defender Firewall and iptables on Linux systems.

### Packet Filtering Firewall (Stateless)
This is typically part of a router firewall, allowing or denying traffic based on Layer 3 and Layer 4 information. It uses a simple policy table lookup to filter traffic based on specific criteria.

### Active or Stateful Firewall
This is the most versatile and most commonly used firewall technology. It provides packet filtering using connection information maintained in a state table. Stateful filtering is a firewall architecture classified at the network layer. It also analyzes traffic at OSI layers 4 and 5.

### Application Gateway Firewall
Filters information at layers 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the OSI reference model. Most firewall control and filtering is done in software.

### Next-Generation Firewall
Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) go beyond traditional firewalls by including advanced capabilities such as:
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyzes packet content beyond the headers to detect advanced threats.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Detects and blocks malicious activity in real time.
- **Application Control:** Identifies and regulates traffic based on specific applications, not just ports or IP addresses.
- **Cloud Threat Analysis:** Query external databases to identify emerging attack patterns and new threats.
- **User-Based Policies:** Enforces security rules based on user identity, not just IP address.
