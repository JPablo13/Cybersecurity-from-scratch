# Web Fundamentals

## What is the World Wide Web?
The WWW, or World Wide Web, constitutes a global information system where documents and other resources are accessible through this interconnected network of nodes (the Internet). These resources are generally interconnected by hypertext links identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The Web is composed of several elements, such as:
- **Structuring Language**: HTML is responsible for this. As such, it is not a programming language but rather a markup language that allows you to create the skeleton of what a website will be, taking into account the creation of each of its pages.
- **Communication Protocols**: These protocols primarily operate on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols and allow the uploading and downloading of web pages or entire websites that operate a request-response model between a client and a server.
- **URLs**: These act as addresses that allow you to locate each resource available on the network.
- **Browsers**: These are typically graphical applications through which users can interact with online resources. Their main function is to interpret HTML, CSS, or client-side programming languages ​​like JavaScript. This allows them to interpret the code of the web page requested by the client and display it in a simple and visually appealing way.
Something important to mention is that the internet and the web are not the same, but they are infrastructures that currently depend on each other and operate under the same paradigm.

## What is a domain and its types?
A domain is a unique identifier that cannot be repeated on the internet. It is used as an address to facilitate access to specific content, replacing the need to memorize numerical sequences or IP addresses. Instead, you can access the same resource, but in this case, only needing to know character strings.
Each server exposed to the Internet has a unique IP address assigned to it, and to access it remotely, you must enter its IP address. This is where DNS comes into play, allowing address translation.
Domains come in several categories:
- **TLD or Primary Domain**: Top-Level Domains are the highest level of domains within the Internet hierarchy; they are basically the last segments of a domain name located after the last dot.
- **SLD or Secondary Domain**: Second-Level Domains are below the primary domain in the hierarchy. In other words, this is the domain that is generally registered by individuals or entities; therefore, it is the part of the domain name that cannot be repeated.
- **Subdomain**: At the hierarchy level, they are at a lower level than the previous domains. These subdomains can be repeated.

## Components of a URL
Example URL:
https://www.example.com:8080/blog/article?id=123#comments
This stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is an address that uniquely points to a specific resource and is composed of the following:
- **Scheme/Protocol**: Indicates the access method to be used to obtain a resource.
- **Delimiter segment**: Basically represented by **://**, it is used to tell the browser how to interpret the information that follows.
- **Domain/IP**: Identifies the destination host where the resource to be queried is located.
- **Port**: This is an optional component in a URL; it is used only to force the connection to be made through a specific port, using the delimiter and the desired port (**:8080**).
- **Path**: Indicates the specific location of the resource to be queried. This can be composed of multiple segments separated by a slash (**/**).
- **Parameters**: These are used to provide additional parameters to the server for the given request. These parameters are preceded by a question mark (**?**).
- **Fragment/Anchor**: These are represented by a number (**#**) and are generally used to link sections.

## Differences between a website and a web page
A web page is a single document that is part of the World Wide Web and is accessible through a browser. Each web page is identified by a URL, which means it can be found and accessed through its specific link. On the other hand, a website is a set of web pages that are related and grouped under the same domain.
## Hosting, VPS, and Dedicated Server
- **Hosting**: This is the most commonly used option for managing websites; these are generally small sites. Its architecture consists of websites hosted on the same physical server, sharing hardware resources.
- **Dedicated Server**: This provides all of its resources to a single client.
- **VPS or Virtual Private Server**: In this case, each site operates independently and with assigned resources, but within a single device.

## Frontend and Backend and Their Vulnerabilities

### Frontend and Its Vulnerabilities
This focuses on the part of the application with which users interact directly. The most fundamental technologies within it are languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
In the frontend, the most common vulnerabilities are: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### Backend and Its Vulnerabilities
This is the backend of any application, and the one that users don't see. This is the layer where data is processed, user interactions are managed, and the application's logical processes are executed. It is also responsible for communication between the database and the frontend. The main technologies used are Java, Python, Ruby, or PHP, and the implementation of relational or non-relational databases can include APIs with their different protocols.
The main vulnerabilities in the backend are: SQL injections (SQLi), Remote Code Execution (RCE), API access and abuse, or information leakage due to misconfigurations.

## Main web servers
When we talk about web servers, we refer to software that accepts HTTP and HTTPS protocol requests. Their main functions are to process these requests and deliver content; the latter, depending on the request, may also be to manage security between connections or simply keep a log of activity. There are many of these types of servers, but the main ones are:

### Apache
This is one of the most widely used and uses the C programming language. Apache is also based on a modularized structure. In other words, it only allows you to load the modules necessary for the specific web applications you want to serve through it. One such module would be mod_security, which acts as a kind of "firewall."

### Nginx
It is focused on high-traffic environments, load balancing, reverse proxy servers, and efficient delivery of static content.

### IIS
This is created by Microsoft and primarily runs on Windows Server. It is used for applications that require specific Microsoft technologies, such as ASP.NET.

### Apache Tomcat
It implements the Java specifications, specifically those of Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP). It is primarily used to run Java applications.

### Jetty
It is a lightweight server that consumes few resources.

## Main Content Management Systems (CMS)
Content management systems have become popular recently as they allow people without much technical knowledge to create a website. The main types are:

### WordPress
It was originally created to create blogs, but over time it has evolved to the point where nearly 40% of the world's websites use WordPress. As such, WordPress uses PHP as its programming language and relies on MySQL and MariaDB for database management.

### Joomla
You could say it's like WordPress since it also uses PHP and MySQL. The difference is that Joomla is not as user-friendly.

### Drupal
It is designed for websites looking to create a scalable structure.

### HTTP Protocol Information Delivery Methods

These define the action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. These methods include:
- **GET**: Requests the representation of a specific resource. They should only be used for retrieval and should not change the state of the resource. Sends the requested data via the URL.
- **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource. The submitted data is processed in the request body.
- **PUT**: Sends data to the server to update an existing resource or create a new resource.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Used to make partial modifications to a resource.
- **HEAD**: Requests only the metadata associated with the resource without the response body.
- **TRACE**: Allows the client to see what an intermediate server is receiving in a request/proxy chain.
- **CONNECT**: Converts the request/response connection into a transparent communication channel, useful for tunneling through a proxy server. It is primarily used to encrypt HTTPS communications through a proxy. - **OPTIONS**: Used to describe the communication options allowed for the target resource, providing a list of supported HTTP methods.

## Main HTTP protocol headers

These are essential components at both the request and response levels in services that use this protocol; they basically transmit additional information between the client and the server. The main headers are:
- **Host**: Identifies the domain and port that the client wants to access on a server.
- **User-Agent**: Identifies the browser and operating system of the client making the request.
- **Accept**: Specifies the types of content that the client can process.
- **Accept-Language**: Indicates the user's preferred language, allowing the server to respond with a resource in the appropriate language.
- **Accept-Encoding**: Specifies the encoding formats that the client accepts for data understanding.
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the request or response body.
- **Content-Length**: Specifies the size in bytes of the request or response body.
- **Cookie**: Contains cookies sent by the client to the server to maintain state or session.
- **Connection**: Specifies whether the connection to the server should be kept open or closed after the request is completed.
- **Referer**: Specifies the source URL from which the requested resource was accessed.
- **Authorization**: Specifies the credentials required to authenticate the client with the server.
- **Cache-Control**: Specifies cache directives for both requests and responses, controlling how data is stored and retrieved.
- **X-Forwarded-For**: Specifies the original IP address of the client, used by intermediate servers or proxies.
- **Set-Cookie**: Instructs the client to store a cookie and specifies its value along with attributes such as expiration, path, and domain.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Specifies settings for the protection filter against (XXS) attacks in shareable browsers.
## HTTP Status Codes

They provide a quick indication of the outcome of a client's request. Based on the status code received, the status of the request sent can be interpreted. These status codes can be divided into five categories:

### 1XX or Informational Responses
These status codes indicate that the request has been received and understood by the server, and that processing is in progress. The most relevant status code is 100, which indicates that the client can continue sending the rest of the request.

### 2XX or Successful Response
Indicates that the request was received, understood, and accepted by the destination server. The most relevant codes are:
- 200 indicates that the request was successful.
- 201 indicates that the request was successful and resulted in the creation of a new resource.
- 204 indicates that the request was successful but there is no content to send.

### 3XX or Redirects
Indicates that further action must be taken by the client to complete the request. The most relevant are:
- 301 indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- 302 indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to another URL.

### 4XX or Client Errors
These codes indicate the existence of an error. The most common are:
- 400 indicates that the request could not be understood or was malformed.
- 401 indicates that the request requires authentication.
- 403 indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- 404 indicates that the requested resource was not found on the server.

### 5XX or Server Errors
These are errors that occur on the server side. The most common are:
- 500 indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from completing the request. - 502 indicates that the server, acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response.
- 503 indicates that the server is temporarily unavailable.
